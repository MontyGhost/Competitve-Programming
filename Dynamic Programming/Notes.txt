1)Let's take a simple example: Problem: Given an array of integers of size n.We've to answer Q queries.
Each query consists of 2 integers L and R and we've to print sum of elements of array from L to R(inclusive).

2) Fibonacci no.'s (top down and bottom up approach).

3) Longest increasing subsequence.

4) Longest common subsequence.

5)Knapsack

***** always use mset(dp,-1);

******making iter dp from recursive dp

******dp[i]=ans;
	  return ans;

considering subtrees
iterative dp on trees.Use BFS and go from highest level to lowest(0)(root).
