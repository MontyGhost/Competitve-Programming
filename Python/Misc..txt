#None is variable of type <class 'NoneType'>.None is the return type of function with no return statement.

#In functions parameters are passed by reference

#Variable-length arguments:You may need to process a function for more arguments than you specified while defining the function.

#Note that 'in' is a membership function which checks for memebrship in seq. such as lists, tuples and strings.

#Python is Interpreted: Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.

#Quotation in Python:

made up of multiple lines and sentences."""

#2 new function passing techniqes:
Keyword arguments:Keyword arguments are related to the function calls. When you use keyword arguments in a function call, the caller identifies the arguments by the parameter name.
