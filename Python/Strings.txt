Unicode String
In Python 3, all strings are represented in Unicode.In Python 2 are stored internally as 8-bit ASCII, hence it is required to attach 'u' to make it Unicode. It is no longer necessary now.

Python does not support a character type; these are treated as strings of length one, thus also considered a substring.\

a[1:4] will give ell for a="Hello" (from 1 to 3)

Quotation in Python:
word = 'word'
sentence = "This is a sentence."
paragraph = """This is a paragraph. It is
made up of multiple lines and sentences."""

Use \  for escaping characters

can use [] with strings for accessing but not for modifying

member functions and other built in functions:
s.len()  or len(s),s.lower() , s.upper()// upper and lower donot change the original string
s.isalpha() returns false if strings contains numbers
list=s.split("delimitor")
lstrip ,rstrip,strip #for stripping \n
startswith:determines if a string starts with a given substring

+ can be used to concatenate strings or print strings + str(number) 

int(string)# converts string into int only if it contains integers

in can be used to find whether a substring exists in a string or to get posn: use find(substring,start pos)

ord(x):converts a character to its integer value
