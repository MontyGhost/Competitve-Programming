==>Constructor must be declared in the public section of the class.
 
==>Constructors are of three types :

1)Default Constructor:Default constructor is the constructor which doesn't take any argument. It has no parameter.
2)Parametrized Constructor:These are the constructors with parameter. Using this Constructor you can provide different values to data members of different objects, by passing the appropriate values as argument.
3)Copy Constructor:These are the constructors with parameter. Using this Constructor you can provide different values to data members of different objects, by passing the appropriate values as argument.

==>In C++, compiler creates a default constructor if we dont define our own constructor . Compiler created default constructor has empty body, i.e., it doesnt assign default values to data members .

==>Read constructor overloading from here:http://www.studytonight.com/cpp/constructors-and-destructors-in-cpp
Compiler doesnt create a default constructor if we write any constructor even if it is copy constructor. 

==>Compiler also creates a copy constructor if we dont write our own copy constructor. Unlike default constructor, body of compiler created copy constructor is not empty, it copies all data members of passed object to the object which is being created.

What happens when we write only a copy constructor  does compiler create default constructor?
Compiler doesn’t create a default constructor if we write any constructor even if it is copy constructor. 

What about reverse – what happens when we write a normal constructor and don’t write a copy constructor?
Reverse is not true. Compiler creates a copy constructor if we don’t write our own. Compiler creates it even if we have written other constructors in class.  

When we create our own copy constructor, we pass an object by reference and we generally pass it as a const reference. 
One reason for passing const reference is, we should use const in C++ wherever possible so that objects are not accidentally modified.
Just place const keyword before class name.
