10) 6.6 is double ,6.6 f is float.
11)
12)Size of an empty class is 1 byte.
13)Friend function doesnot behave like a member function but it behaves like all the private data has been made public for it.
14)A static variable is shared by all the objects of the class,it is allocated memory only once,along w/ declartion it also needs to be defined,its default value is 
zero.
Declaration- static int count;
Definition-int class_name :: count;// default value zero
int class_name :: count=10;
15) A static member function can be accessed w/o objects. It can only use static data members.A function can be made static by writing the keyword static infront of it.
Syntax for calling:class_name::function _name.
16)Local classes-Read notes.
17)Pointers to data member- int A::*ptr=&A::dm;
Pointer to member function-void(A::*ptr)(int,int)=&(A::show) while calling  -(A.*ptr)(arguements) 
18) Member function of a class as a friend to another class-write the class containing function first.
19)Constructors Destructor and  copy constructor-notes.In case of overloading of >> operator , istream object is passed by reference and in case of cascading of >> 
oeprator istream object is returned by reference.
23)operator which cant be overloaded are .,.*,::,?:.
24)operator which can t be overloaded using a friend function:  == () [] ->
25)You need to pass the stream by reference, because streams are not generally copyable:
21)templates-notes.
20)type conversion and operator overloading-notes.

22)Console i/o -class notes + notes.
26)Inheritence-notes.
