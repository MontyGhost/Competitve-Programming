In case of quadratic sorting algos, linear time best case complexity is for insertion and bubble sort(modiified).
Non comparison sorting algos:Counting,Bucket and radix sort
quick sort and merge sort:start<end  binary search: start<=end

How to make counting sort stable
Complexity of radix sort:http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.006/spring11/exams/notes2-1.pdf :Take appropriate base in log to minimize complexiy
Why binary insertion sort is not helpful:
The algorithm as a whole still has a running worst case running time of O(n^2) because of the series of swaps required for each insertion.
union and intersection of 2 sorted arrays.
two pointer
Heap Sort, Quick Sort are not stable.
Heap :increase key operation.
==>Two pointer:Given an array A[] and a number x, check for pair in A[] with sum as x
