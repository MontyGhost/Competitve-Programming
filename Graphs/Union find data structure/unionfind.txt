1 based indexing
Union (when both elements are not root)
The elements are believed to be from 1 to N.

Running time of both union and find:
Naive:O(n)
Balanced:O(lgn)
With path compression:O(lg*n) i.e.log *N is the iterative function which computes the number of times you have to take log of N till the value of N doesnt reaches to 1.
log*N is much better than log N, as its value reaches at most up to 5 in the real world.
