Donot try to dereference a null pointer.

container.end() is pointer to one past the end.

Use memset to set values 0 or -1.(Even avoid with -1)
memset is an operation that sets bits.

If you want to set a value use a for-loop.

Consider a 4-bit-integer:

Its value is 1 when the bits are 0001 but memset sets it to 1111

Representing a sequence in terms of bit values. Whether the term is there (1) or not(0).

use abs() for ints and fabs() for doubles

getchar() while i/p array of characters.

use of ceil and floor.

conditions in if.

inputting the numbers until you hit a newline character.

linear time doest not mean only one traversal.
linear time o(2n) o(k+n) etc.

to declare a global array w/ size specified in main use a vector.

mp<ll,vector<ll> >mp;

priority queue & binary search.

taking excessive % may have impact of time complexity of algo.

sheldon cooper technique

structure instead of tuple

array should not go out of the bounds or excessing an empty container

variable name clash

sorting of a=vector of string takes O(n*k*log(n)) time where k is the length of longest string 

Global array purana data remove

cout.precision(10) std::fixed

long double

unordered set

to input a string with spaces using cin.getline . note here c style string is to be used.

sorting and doing in nlgn time

binary search 1 important question from codemonk:Monk's Encounter with Polynomial	

s.size() is unsingned integer .so s.size()-100 may give wrong value if its < 100. 

donot redeclare a global variable as a a local variable.

use of return 0 to terminate a program midway.
