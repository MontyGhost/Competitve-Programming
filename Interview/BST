==>Three types of tree traversals.Use of inorder traversal in BST.
==>Inorder Successor:If a node has right subtree ,find min. element in the right subtree
					:If a node doesnt has right subtree, find nearest ancestor for which the node will be in the left subtree.
					(This can be done with maintaining parent pointers and without maintaining parent pointers==>Traverse the tree from 					ancestor to that particular node)
==>Deletion in BST:http://quiz.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search-tree-set-2-delete/
==>Order statistics in BST:Only store the number of children in the left subtree.
==>Binary Tree to Binary Search Tree Conversion==>Using inorder traversal.
==>http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sorted-array-to-balanced-bst/==>make recursively
==>http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-two-bsts-with-limited-extra-space/==>use logic similar to merging two sorted arrays
==>http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fix-two-swapped-nodes-of-bst/==>make your own approach
