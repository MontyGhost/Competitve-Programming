remember when someone tells you addition is O(n) operations, he does not mean n is value of input, but n denotes the size of input (bits required to represent N
2 coin change
2 knapsack
LCS(2)
LIS(1)
Kadane's Algo is used to find the subarray with maximum sum
**Never use LCS to find LPS (S-->substring) Ex:abdpqdba
Palindromes
Substring:Use function ispalin
Subsequence:Similar to LCS(S-->Subsequence)
MCM==>Time Complexity O(n^3)
LIS:http://codeforces.com/blog/entry/8761?#comment-144867
BIT masking
Catalan Number==>1) Count the number of expressions containing n pairs of parentheses which are correctly matched.
2)Count the number of possible Binary Search Trees with n keys (See this)
Formula (2n Chose n)/(n+1)  and C0=1
Edit Distance
Subset Sum==>Set 0th bit and bit=bit|bit<<no
