==>While calculating the complexity of recursive algorithms, for the term T(n/k) , it is not necessary to equate n/k to 1 . We can equate to to 2,3,4 or some other smaller constant.
==>While solving output for recursion questions,make a tree like structure
==>Master method doesnt work if the polynomial term is negative.
==>Reducible to master method
==>A polynomial cannot have fractional powers
==>Read abt. Master Method and Substitution Method for finding complexities of algos.
